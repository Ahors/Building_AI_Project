# Detecting the need for macronutrients

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The project would include a person keeping a journal (on their phone etc.) about their macronutrient intakes and activities. The AI would recommend spesific additions or deductions to the diet based on the given information.


## Background

It solves the basic needs of your body; macronutrient intakes. Protein, carbohydrates and fats. The problem with most diet apps or courses are that they focus too much on what's the norm for the basic body type. This is a very personal problem since I've been trying to keep up with multiple diets and calculating my macronutrients to the grams. I think this project would improve the fitness apps or programs.

## How is it used?

As mentioned earlier the target subjects would be anyone who wants to improve their body composition. Common saying is that 90% of abs (abdominal muscles) are made in the kitchen. This app would provide, and make the journey much more easier. 

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
