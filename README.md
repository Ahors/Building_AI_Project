# Detecting the need for macronutrients

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The project would include a person keeping a journal (on their phone etc.) about their macronutrient intakes and activities. The AI would recommend spesific additions or deductions to the diet based on the given information.


## Background

It solves the basic needs of your body; macronutrient intakes. Protein, carbohydrates and fats. The problem with most diet apps or courses are that they focus too much on what's the norm for the basic body type. This is a very personal problem since I've been trying to keep up with multiple diets and calculating my macronutrients to the grams. I think this project would improve the fitness apps or programs.

## How is it used?

As mentioned earlier the target subjects would be anyone who wants to improve their body composition. Common saying is that 90% of abs (abdominal muscles) are made in the kitchen. This app would provide, and make the journey much more easier for end users.

## Data sources and AI methods
Data would be collected by ourselves; the more people join the program, the more accurate the model woul become. There's a possibility to build a prototype model using beta testers and then improve from that. The AI would look for similarities between certain activities and macronutrient intakes. We would possibly need a global database that has information about exercising and the effects they have on different types of people, so the AI model would personalize your program plan.

## Challenges

There are too many body types to keep track of and users would constantly need to update their activities, weight, macro intakes etc. which is kind of laborious and unintuitive.

## What next?

The project would definitely need some experts on the fields of human anatomy and on different fields of exercises, including rock climbing, hiking, running, cycling, weightlifting etc.
